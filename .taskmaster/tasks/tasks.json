Error Handling & Logging ✅\n- **ErrorBoundary Component**: Created robust error boundary with graceful fallback UI, debug info in development, and structured error logging\n- **Enhanced Logger Utility**: Comprehensive logging system with multiple levels (debug, info, warn, error), in-memory storage, performance tracking, and API call logging\n- **Integration Ready**: Both components ready for production crash reporting services (Sentry, Crashlytics)\n\n### 2. Testing Infrastructure ✅\n- **Jest Configuration**: Set up complete testing environment with Jest, React Native Testing Library, and comprehensive mocking\n- **Test Coverage**: Created comprehensive tests for Button component (all variants, sizes, interactions, edge cases)\n- **Navigation Testing**: Created tests for ConversationScreen with navigation mocking and user interaction testing\n- **Performance Monitoring**: 70% coverage threshold configured for quality assurance\n\n### 3. Performance Optimizations (Partial) ⚠️\n- **Memoization Started**: Began implementing React.memo, useCallback, and useMemo patterns\n- **Testing Performance**: All test infrastructure optimized for fast execution\n- **Note**: Some React.memo syntax issues encountered due to complex component structure - will complete in next iteration\n\n### 4. Development Quality ✅\n- **Type Safety**: All error handling and logging fully typed with TypeScript strict mode\n- **Lint Compliance**: Fixed all TypeScript strict optional property issues\n- **Test Configuration**: Fixed ES module compatibility issues for Jest configuration\n\n## Technical Implementation Details:\n- ErrorBoundary with custom fallback support and development debug mode\n- Logger with structured entries, crash reporting integration, and performance metrics\n- Complete test mocking for Expo, React Navigation, and Zustand stores\n- Jest configuration optimized for React Native and TypeScript\n\n## Ready for Next Steps:\n- Error boundaries can be wrapped around App.tsx or individual screens\n- Logger integrated into user actions and API calls\n- Test coverage provides confidence for future refactoring\n- Performance patterns template established for component optimization\n</info added on 2025-07-07T03:25:28.966Z>",
