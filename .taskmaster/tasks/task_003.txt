# Task ID: 3
# Title: Integrate Gemini Live Audio API
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement authentication and session management for Gemini Live Audio API.
# Details:
Obtain API credentials. Implement client-side authentication. Create session management logic for initiating, maintaining, and closing Live Audio sessions. Handle API errors and retries.

# Test Strategy:
Test session initiation, real-time audio streaming, and error handling. Validate API responses and session lifecycle.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Obtain and Secure API Credentials [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Register the application with the backend or third-party audio API provider to obtain necessary credentials (e.g., client ID, client secret, API keys). Store credentials securely using platform-specific secure storage (Keychain for iOS, Keystore for Android) and never hardcode secrets in the codebase.
### Details:
Follow OAuth 2.0 or similar protocols for secure credential handling. Ensure credentials are encrypted and inaccessible to unauthorized users. Document the credential acquisition and storage process for maintainability.

## 2. Implement Authentication Flow [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Develop a robust authentication system using OAuth 2.0 and JWT, supporting multiple login options (e.g., email, social logins). Ensure clear error handling, concise error messages, and retry mechanisms for failed logins.
### Details:
Use TypeScript interfaces for strong typing. Separate authentication logic into dedicated modules/services. Validate and securely store tokens. Follow React Native best practices for performance and user experience.

## 3. Design and Implement Session Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Create mechanisms to initiate, maintain, and close user sessions securely. Implement session timeouts, inactivity logouts, and token revocation. Store session tokens securely and handle session lifecycle events.
### Details:
Use secure storage for tokens. Ensure session management logic is modular and testable. Apply encryption and session expiration best practices to prevent hijacking.

## 4. Integrate Real-Time Audio API [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Connect the app to the real-time audio processing backend/API, ensuring authenticated requests and efficient data streaming. Handle complex audio data flows and maintain low latency.
### Details:
Abstract API integration logic into reusable TypeScript modules. Optimize for React Native performance (e.g., use native modules where necessary). Ensure separation of concerns between UI, business logic, and API communication.

## 5. Implement Comprehensive Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2, 3.3, 3.4
### Description: Develop a unified error handling strategy across authentication, session management, and API integration. Provide user-friendly error messages and robust logging for debugging.
### Details:
Use TypeScript enums and error classes for consistent error representation. Ensure all asynchronous operations are wrapped with try/catch and errors are surfaced appropriately to the UI and logs.

## 6. Test and Validate Real-Time Streaming and Security [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5
### Description: Write comprehensive tests for authentication, session lifecycle, error handling, and real-time audio streaming. Include unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. Validate security using OWASP guidelines and simulate edge cases.
### Details:
Use automated testing tools and frameworks compatible with React Native and TypeScript. Test for session fixation, token expiration, streaming interruptions, and error recovery. Ensure code coverage and maintainability.
