# Task ID: 16
# Title: Optimize Performance and Scalability
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 5, 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement performance optimizations and scalability measures.
# Details:
Cache prompt templates in Edge Function memory. Use Redis for active user sessions. Compress audio before upload. Stream Gemini responses for faster perceived performance.

# Test Strategy:
Test performance under load. Validate caching, audio compression, and response streaming.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Prompt Template Caching Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement a caching mechanism for prompt templates to reduce latency and API costs, ensuring cache expiration and invalidation policies are in place.
### Details:
Use TypeScript interfaces for cache entries, provide explicit types, and ensure separation of caching logic from business logic. Integrate with backend APIs as needed. Include comprehensive error handling for cache misses and failures. Write unit tests for cache operations.

## 2. Integrate Redis for Scalable Caching [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Integrate Redis as the backend for the caching layer to support high-throughput, low-latency access to prompt templates and other frequently accessed data.
### Details:
Use a well-maintained TypeScript Redis client. Abstract Redis operations behind a service layer. Ensure robust error handling for connection and operation failures. Write integration tests for Redis interactions.

## 3. Implement Real-Time Audio Compression Module [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a performant audio compression module suitable for real-time processing, ensuring minimal latency and high audio fidelity.
### Details:
Follow React Native performance patterns and TypeScript best practices. Separate audio processing logic from UI components. Handle errors gracefully, especially for unsupported formats or device limitations. Provide unit and integration tests for audio processing.

## 4. Stream Gemini Model Responses with Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.2, 16.3
### Description: Implement streaming of Gemini model responses to the client, ensuring smooth real-time updates and robust error handling for network or backend failures.
### Details:
Use TypeScript types for streamed data. Maintain clean separation between streaming logic and UI rendering. Implement retry and fallback mechanisms. Write tests for streaming edge cases and error scenarios.

## 5. Conduct Load Testing for Real-Time Audio and Caching [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.4
### Description: Design and execute load tests to evaluate system performance under high concurrency, focusing on real-time audio processing and caching subsystems.
### Details:
Use automated tools to simulate realistic usage patterns. Measure latency, throughput, and resource utilization. Identify bottlenecks in audio processing, caching, and streaming. Document findings and suggest optimizations.

## 6. Validate Performance and Maintainability [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.5
### Description: Validate that the system meets performance, scalability, and maintainability goals, with a focus on clean code, error handling, and comprehensive testing.
### Details:
Review code for adherence to TypeScript and React Native best practices, including explicit typing, component decomposition, and separation of concerns. Ensure all modules have thorough test coverage and clear error handling. Document architecture and testing outcomes.
