# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Error Handling and Fallbacks
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add robust error handling and fallback strategies.
# Details:
Handle Live Audio API connection issues, audio quality problems, and network interruptions. Implement session reconnection, state preservation, and backup STS integration. Add graceful error messages and retry prompts.

# Test Strategy:
Test error scenarios, fallback mechanisms, and user messaging. Validate session recovery and backup transcription.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Robust API Connection Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement resilient API connection logic with retries, exponential backoff, and clear error boundaries. Ensure all API interactions are strongly typed using TypeScript interfaces and types.
### Details:
Use clean code principles for separation of concerns. Abstract API logic into dedicated modules/services. Handle all error states gracefully and provide hooks for UI updates. Write comprehensive unit tests for all API utilities.

## 2. Implement Real-Time Audio Quality Monitoring and Recovery [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Develop mechanisms to detect and recover from audio quality degradation in real time, including jitter, packet loss, and latency spikes.
### Details:
Leverage background threads or native modules for audio processing to avoid blocking the JS thread. Use React Native performance patterns to minimize UI impact. Ensure all audio processing code is modular and testable.

## 3. Handle Network Interruptions and Automatic Session Reconnection [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Detect network interruptions and implement seamless session reconnection logic, including state restoration and user notification.
### Details:
Use throttling/debouncing to avoid excessive reconnection attempts. Maintain session state in a dedicated context or store. Ensure reconnection logic is thoroughly tested under various network conditions.

## 4. Integrate Backup STS (Session Token Service) Fallback [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.3
### Description: Implement a backup STS mechanism to ensure authentication and session continuity if the primary STS fails.
### Details:
Abstract STS logic into a service with clear interfaces. Use dependency injection for easy swapping between primary and backup STS. Ensure all error and fallback paths are covered by tests.

## 5. Develop User Messaging and Feedback for Connection and Audio Issues [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2, 11.3, 11.4
### Description: Provide clear, actionable user messages for API, audio, and network issues, ensuring a responsive and informative UI.
### Details:
Use React Native best practices for UI updates. Ensure messages are accessible and localized. Separate messaging logic from business logic for maintainability.

## 6. Comprehensive Testing and Performance Profiling [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2, 11.3, 11.4, 11.5
### Description: Write exhaustive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for all error handling, reconnection, and audio processing logic. Profile performance and optimize bottlenecks.
### Details:
Use TypeScript for all test code. Employ React Native profiling tools and background thread strategies to ensure smooth performance. Test under real-world network and device conditions.
