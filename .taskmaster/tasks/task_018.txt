# Task ID: 18
# Title: Conduct Internal Testing and Feedback Collection
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 7, 14
# Priority: high
# Description: Run internal testing and collect user feedback.
# Details:
Invite 10 internal testers to complete all 3 conversations. Collect feedback on conversation quality, emotional response, and learning value. Monitor technical validation metrics (latency, transcription accuracy, AI response quality).

# Test Strategy:
Review tester feedback and technical metrics. Validate core conversation flow and user experience.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Recruit and Onboard Testers [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify, recruit, and onboard testers with relevant experience in React Native, TypeScript, and real-time audio processing. Ensure testers understand the project's technical requirements and clean code standards.
### Details:
Prepare onboarding materials emphasizing TypeScript best practices, React Native performance patterns, and maintainable architecture. Communicate expectations for error handling and comprehensive testing.

## 2. Prepare Comprehensive Test Scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Design and document test scenarios that cover real-time audio processing, backend integration, error handling, and separation of concerns. Ensure scenarios reflect user-centric interactions and technical edge cases.
### Details:
Utilize strict typing for props and state, and leverage user-centric testing approaches as recommended for React Native. Include scenarios for both functional and non-functional requirements, such as performance and maintainability.

## 3. Collect and Organize Tester Feedback [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.2
### Description: Establish structured feedback channels for testers to report issues, suggest improvements, and document their experiences. Integrate feedback collection with existing collaboration tools and workflows.
### Details:
Implement processes for tracking, prioritizing, and acting on feedback. Ensure feedback covers code quality, error handling, architecture, and real-time audio processing performance.

## 4. Analyze Technical Metrics and Feedback [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.3
### Description: Aggregate and analyze technical metrics (e.g., error rates, performance benchmarks) alongside tester feedback to identify trends and prioritize improvements. Document findings and communicate actionable insights to stakeholders.
### Details:
Use error tracking systems and monitoring tools to support data-driven analysis. Focus on maintainability, code quality, and adherence to TypeScript and React Native best practices.
