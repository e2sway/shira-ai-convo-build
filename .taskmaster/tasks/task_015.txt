# Task ID: 15
# Title: Develop Testing Infrastructure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up automated and manual testing frameworks.
# Details:
Configure Jest and Detox for unit and integration tests. Set up manual testing checklist for core flows. Prepare test data and scenarios for MVP conversations.

# Test Strategy:
Run automated and manual tests. Validate test coverage and checklist completion.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Configure Jest for TypeScript and React Native [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up Jest with TypeScript support and React Native presets, ensuring proper transformation of ES modules (e.g., React Navigation) and adherence to clean code practices, error handling, and maintainable architecture.
### Details:
Create or update a jest.config.ts file using TypeScript best practices. Ensure transformIgnorePatterns includes necessary modules like @react-navigation. Enable verbose output and integrate with ts-node if needed. Follow React Native and TypeScript configuration guidelines for maintainability and separation of concerns.[1][3][5]

## 2. Set Up Detox for End-to-End Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Initialize Detox with Jest integration for automated end-to-end testing, focusing on robust error handling and maintainable test scaffolding.
### Details:
Run 'detox init -r jest' to scaffold e2e tests. Review and customize generated files (e2e/config.json, e2e/environment.js, e2e/firstTest.e2e.js). Ensure Detox works seamlessly with the Jest setup and supports real-time audio processing and backend integration scenarios.[2]

## 3. Prepare Manual Test Checklists [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2
### Description: Develop comprehensive manual test checklists covering real-time audio processing, backend integration, and performance patterns, ensuring clear separation of concerns and error scenarios.
### Details:
Document manual test cases for critical flows, edge cases, and error handling. Include steps for verifying audio processing accuracy, backend data consistency, and React Native performance optimizations. Ensure checklists are maintainable and align with clean code principles.

## 4. Create and Manage Test Data [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.3
### Description: Design and implement test data sets for both automated and manual tests, supporting complex real-time audio and backend integration requirements.
### Details:
Develop scripts or fixtures for generating and managing test data. Ensure data covers a wide range of scenarios, including edge cases for audio processing and backend responses. Maintain data in a modular, reusable format to support separation of concerns and maintainability.

## 5. Validate Test Coverage and Quality [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.4
### Description: Analyze and validate test coverage for both unit and end-to-end tests, ensuring comprehensive coverage of critical paths, error handling, and performance bottlenecks.
### Details:
Use Jest's coverage tools to generate reports. Review coverage for real-time audio processing, backend integration, and performance-critical code. Address gaps by adding or refining tests. Ensure all code follows TypeScript best practices, clean architecture, and maintainable patterns.
