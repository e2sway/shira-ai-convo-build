# Task ID: 12
# Title: Develop Accessibility Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement accessibility and inclusivity features.
# Details:
Add visual transcription, adjustable playback speed, high contrast mode, and large text support. Ensure interface language options (English/Spanish). Design inclusive avatar options and scenarios.

# Test Strategy:
Test accessibility features on multiple devices. Validate language and cultural sensitivity.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Visual Transcription Component [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a React Native component for real-time visual transcription of audio, ensuring accurate synchronization and accessibility for screen readers. Use TypeScript for type safety and maintain clean separation of concerns.
### Details:
Focus on efficient state management, error handling for audio input/output, and provide text alternatives for non-text content. Ensure the component exposes accessibility labels and supports assistive technology actions.

## 2. Add Playback Speed Controls [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Create user interface controls to adjust playback speed of audio and transcription, ensuring accessibility and proper error handling for unsupported speeds or device limitations.
### Details:
Implement accessible buttons/sliders with clear accessibility labels and focus management. Use TypeScript interfaces for props and state. Handle edge cases such as invalid speed values or audio processing errors.

## 3. Enable High Contrast Mode and Large Text [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Integrate high contrast color schemes and large text options, allowing users to toggle these settings for improved readability and accessibility.
### Details:
Follow WCAG guidelines for visual presentation, allow user customization of text/background colors, and ensure line spacing and width are accessible. Use React Native accessibility props and test across devices.

## 4. Implement Language Options [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Provide a mechanism for users to select their preferred language for both UI and transcription output, supporting localization and internationalization best practices.
### Details:
Use TypeScript enums or types for supported languages, ensure all text content is translatable, and handle errors for unsupported or unavailable languages. Integrate with backend for language-specific transcription models if needed.

## 5. Design Inclusive Avatars and Scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a set of avatars and scenario illustrations that reflect diverse user backgrounds and abilities, ensuring visual assets are accessible and inclusive.
### Details:
Provide text alternatives for all non-text images, use accessible color palettes, and ensure avatars/scenarios are meaningful for all users. Collaborate with designers to maintain clean code and asset management.

## 6. Comprehensive Testing and Backend Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 12.5
### Description: Develop and execute comprehensive tests for all accessibility features, including real-time audio processing and backend integration for transcription and language services.
### Details:
Write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests using TypeScript. Test across devices and assistive technologies. Ensure robust error handling for backend failures and maintain a modular, maintainable architecture.
