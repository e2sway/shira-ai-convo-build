# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Session Orchestration Edge Function
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop Supabase Edge Function to orchestrate Live Audio sessions.
# Details:
Write initiateLiveSession Edge Function. Fetch user state, assemble initial system prompt, and initiate Live Audio session. Return session handle and initial transcript. Handle errors and retries.

# Test Strategy:
Test function invocation, prompt assembly, and session initiation. Validate error handling and response parsing.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement the Edge Function [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a TypeScript-based Edge Function for session orchestration, ensuring clean code structure, modularity, and maintainability. Follow best practices for file organization and configuration as recommended for Edge Functions.
### Details:
Set up the Edge Function in the appropriate directory, define the handler and configuration, and ensure the function is globally distributed for low-latency. Use TypeScript features for type safety and maintainability. Structure the code to allow for easy extension and testing.

## 2. Fetch and Manage User State [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Implement logic within the Edge Function to securely fetch and manage user state, ensuring proper separation of concerns and robust error handling.
### Details:
Integrate with backend or state management systems to retrieve user session data. Validate and sanitize input, handle missing or malformed data gracefully, and ensure that state management logic is encapsulated and reusable.

## 3. Assemble Prompts and Initiate Sessions [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Develop the logic to assemble prompts based on user state and initiate new sessions, considering real-time audio processing requirements and backend integration.
### Details:
Design prompt assembly as a modular function, allowing for future extensibility. Ensure session initiation logic is decoupled from prompt assembly. Integrate with backend services for session tracking and audio processing, maintaining clear interfaces and type definitions.

## 4. Implement Comprehensive Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Add robust error handling throughout the Edge Function, including user state fetching, prompt assembly, and session initiation. Ensure meaningful error messages and proper logging.
### Details:
Use try/catch blocks, custom error types, and logging frameworks to capture and report errors. Ensure that errors are handled gracefully and do not expose sensitive information. Provide clear feedback for both developers and users.

## 5. Develop and Execute Comprehensive Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.4
### Description: Write and run unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for all components of the Edge Function, focusing on correctness, performance, and maintainability.
### Details:
Use TypeScript-compatible testing frameworks to validate all logic, including edge cases and error scenarios. Test real-time audio processing flows and backend integrations. Ensure tests are modular, maintainable, and provide high coverage.
