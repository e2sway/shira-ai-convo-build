# Task ID: 17
# Title: Prepare Deployment and Release Pipeline
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 15
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up deployment and release process for MVP.
# Details:
Configure Expo EAS for iOS and Android builds. Set up CI/CD pipeline for Edge Functions and database updates. Prepare release notes and changelog.

# Test Strategy:
Test deployment on staging environment. Validate build and release process.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Configure Expo EAS for Multi-Environment Support [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up Expo EAS with environment-specific configurations, ensuring clean code practices, TypeScript best practices, and maintainable architecture. Integrate Expo EAS profiles for development, preview, and production environments, and configure code signing for secure OTA updates.
### Details:
Create and configure the eas.json file with multiple build profiles. Update app.config files to use environment variables. Ensure all configuration code is type-safe and modular. Implement code signing for update security. Follow Expo and TypeScript best practices for configuration management.

## 2. Set Up CI/CD Pipeline for Edge Functions and Backend Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Implement a CI/CD pipeline that automates building, testing, and deploying Edge Functions and backend services. Ensure proper error handling, comprehensive testing, and separation of concerns in pipeline scripts.
### Details:
Use EAS Build and custom scripts to automate deployments. Integrate with version control and CI/CD tools (e.g., GitHub Actions). Ensure pipeline scripts are written in TypeScript where possible, with clear error handling and logging. Validate backend integration points and real-time audio processing requirements.

## 3. Manage Database Migrations with Automation and Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.2
### Description: Automate database migrations as part of the CI/CD process, ensuring migrations are tested, reversible, and maintainable. Apply clean code and error handling standards.
### Details:
Integrate migration tools (e.g., Prisma, TypeORM) into the pipeline. Write migration scripts in TypeScript, with comprehensive tests for both forward and rollback scenarios. Ensure migrations are idempotent and include validation steps. Document migration procedures for maintainability.

## 4. Prepare and Automate Release Notes Generation [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.3
### Description: Develop a process to generate and review release notes automatically as part of the deployment pipeline, ensuring clarity and traceability of changes.
### Details:
Use commit messages, PR descriptions, and CI/CD metadata to generate release notes. Automate the process using tools like conventional-changelog. Ensure release notes are reviewed for accuracy and completeness before each release.

## 5. Validate Staging Deployments with Comprehensive Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.4
### Description: Deploy to a staging environment and validate deployments with automated and manual tests, focusing on real-time audio processing, backend integration, and React Native performance patterns.
### Details:
Run end-to-end, integration, and performance tests on the staging environment. Validate real-time audio features and backend connectivity. Ensure code follows React Native and TypeScript best practices, with clear separation of concerns and robust error handling. Document test results and issues.
