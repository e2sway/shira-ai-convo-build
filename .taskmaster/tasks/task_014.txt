# Task ID: 14
# Title: Set Up Analytics and Event Tracking
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement core KPIs and event tracking.
# Details:
Track conversation_started, voice_input_attempted, feedback_received, emotional_support_triggered, conversation_completed. Log engagement metrics (DAU, session duration, voice interaction rate). Store analytics in Supabase.

# Test Strategy:
Test event logging and analytics collection. Validate data accuracy and reporting.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Analytics KPIs and Event Schema [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify key performance indicators (KPIs) and specify the event schema for tracking user engagement and audio processing interactions. Ensure metrics align with business goals and real-time audio processing requirements.
### Details:
Document all KPIs, event names, and required properties. Include user traits, engagement metrics, and audio processing events. Ensure schema is type-safe and extensible for future analytics needs.

## 2. Implement Event Tracking in React Native with TypeScript [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Instrument the React Native app to track defined events using a library such as Segment or Firebase Analytics, following TypeScript best practices and React Native performance patterns.
### Details:
Use hooks or context providers for analytics. Ensure all event payloads are strongly typed. Apply separation of concerns by isolating analytics logic from UI components. Optimize for minimal performance impact, especially during real-time audio processing.

## 3. Log and Aggregate Engagement Metrics [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2
### Description: Develop logic to log and aggregate user engagement metrics, including session duration, feature usage, and audio processing events, ensuring clean code and robust error handling.
### Details:
Centralize metric logging in a dedicated analytics service. Handle errors gracefully and ensure no data loss. Use TypeScript interfaces for metric structures. Maintain clear separation between logging, aggregation, and UI layers.

## 4. Integrate Analytics Data with Supabase Backend [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.3
### Description: Connect the analytics layer to Supabase for storing and querying engagement and event data, ensuring secure, maintainable, and scalable backend integration.
### Details:
Implement API calls or direct Supabase client usage with proper authentication and error handling. Use environment variables for configuration. Ensure backend schemas match frontend event types. Follow clean architecture principles for maintainability.

## 5. Validate Data Accuracy and Implement Comprehensive Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.4
### Description: Establish automated and manual testing procedures to validate the accuracy of tracked data, backend integration, and real-time event delivery. Ensure maintainable test architecture.
### Details:
Write unit and integration tests for analytics logic using TypeScript. Simulate real-time audio events and verify correct logging and backend storage. Implement error case tests and data consistency checks. Document testing strategy and coverage.
