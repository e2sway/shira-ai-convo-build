# Task ID: 8
# Title: Develop Learning Track Navigation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement UI for Learning Track with progress visualization.
# Details:
Create tab for Learning Track. Display linear path with completed/locked conversations. Add category cards and difficulty indicators. Implement achievement unlocks.

# Test Strategy:
Test navigation, progress visualization, and achievement display. Validate UI responsiveness.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Learning Track Tab Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the overall architecture for the Learning Track tab, ensuring clear separation of concerns, modularity, and maintainability. Establish TypeScript interfaces and types for all core entities (tracks, categories, progress, achievements).
### Details:
Create a scalable folder structure, define reusable components, and set up state management (e.g., Redux, Zustand, or Context API) with atomic state slices for performance. Document architectural decisions and TypeScript contracts.

## 2. Implement Progress Visualization and Navigation [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Develop UI components for visualizing user progress within learning tracks, including progress bars, step indicators, and navigation between modules. Ensure real-time updates and smooth animations.
### Details:
Use performant React Native animation libraries (e.g., Reanimated) and optimize rendering to avoid dropped frames. Handle edge cases and errors in state updates. Write unit and integration tests for progress logic.

## 3. Create Category Cards and Difficulty Indicators [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Build reusable, accessible components for displaying category cards and difficulty indicators. Ensure components are type-safe and follow design guidelines.
### Details:
Implement memoization and atomic state management for performance. Use TypeScript generics and discriminated unions for prop validation. Add comprehensive tests for UI and logic.

## 4. Integrate Achievement Unlocks and Backend Sync [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.3
### Description: Implement logic for unlocking achievements based on user actions and progress. Integrate with backend APIs for real-time sync and persistence.
### Details:
Handle API errors gracefully with retry logic and user feedback. Use optimistic UI updates and ensure consistency between client and server state. Write end-to-end tests for achievement flows.

## 5. Implement Real-Time Audio Processing and Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.4
### Description: Integrate real-time audio processing features required for the learning tracks, ensuring smooth performance and robust error handling.
### Details:
Leverage native modules and optimize threading for audio tasks. Profile and debug using advanced React Native tools. Add crash analytics (e.g., Sentry) and logging for both JS and native errors. Write tests for audio processing logic and error boundaries.
