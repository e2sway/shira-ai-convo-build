# Task ID: 10
# Title: Add Live Audio Feedback and Hint System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate real-time feedback and hints into conversation UI.
# Details:
Display color-coded word highlighting during transcription. Add expandable English feedback. Show alternative phrases and cultural notes. Implement hint cards and contextual scaffolding.

# Test Strategy:
Test feedback display, hint system, and cultural note integration. Validate UI updates and accessibility.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Word Highlighting Component [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a reusable React Native component for highlighting specific words or phrases within a text block, ensuring accessibility and performance.
### Details:
Utilize libraries like react-native-highlight-words or custom nested Text components for flexibility. Ensure the component is type-safe with TypeScript, supports dynamic updates, and is optimized for React Native rendering patterns. Include error handling for invalid input and edge cases such as overlapping highlights.

## 2. Design Feedback Display System [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create a modular feedback display system that can show real-time feedback (e.g., correctness, pronunciation tips) in response to user actions, integrating with audio processing results.
### Details:
Architect the feedback system as a set of isolated components with clear props and state management. Ensure feedback is accessible, visually distinct, and updates in real time. Handle errors from backend or audio processing gracefully, displaying fallback messages as needed.

## 3. Integrate Alternative Phrases and Cultural Notes [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Develop UI modules to present alternative phrases and cultural notes contextually, triggered by user interaction or backend data.
### Details:
Ensure these modules are decoupled from the main UI logic, use TypeScript interfaces for data contracts, and support asynchronous data fetching with robust error handling. Design for maintainability and easy extension.

## 4. Implement Hint Cards and Contextual Scaffolding [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Build hint card components and contextual scaffolding logic to guide users through tasks, leveraging real-time context and user progress.
### Details:
Use React Native performance patterns (e.g., memoization, virtualization) to ensure smooth UI updates. Structure hint logic for easy testing and future scalability. Ensure hints are accessible and can be dismissed or expanded by users.

## 5. Integrate Real-Time Audio Processing and Backend APIs [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.4
### Description: Connect the UI components to real-time audio processing modules and backend APIs for feedback, hints, and content updates.
### Details:
Implement robust TypeScript types for API responses and audio data. Ensure error boundaries and fallback UI for network or processing failures. Optimize for low-latency updates and seamless user experience.

## 6. Comprehensive Testing and Code Quality Assurance [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.5
### Description: Establish a testing strategy covering unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for all components and logic, with a focus on maintainability and clean code.
### Details:
Use TypeScript for static analysis, enforce separation of concerns, and implement automated tests for UI, logic, and error handling. Include accessibility and performance tests. Set up CI/CD pipelines for continuous quality checks.
