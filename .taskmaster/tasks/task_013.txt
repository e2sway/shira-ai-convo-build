# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Emotional Design Elements
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add micro-celebrations, progress visualization, and encouragement patterns.
# Details:
Add confetti for first completions, growing confidence meter, and effort recognition. Implement streak building and daily practice encouragement. Normalize mistakes and emphasize privacy.

# Test Strategy:
Test emotional design elements and user feedback. Validate encouragement and progress visualization.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Micro-Celebrations and Encouragement Patterns [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define and prototype UI/UX elements for micro-celebrations, progress visualization, encouragement, and streak building, ensuring emotional design principles are applied.
### Details:
Work with design and product teams to create wireframes and interaction flows for micro-celebrations (e.g., confetti, badges), progress bars, streak counters, and encouragement messages. Ensure designs are modular and can be easily integrated into React Native components.

## 2. Implement React Native Components with TypeScript [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Develop reusable, well-typed React Native components for micro-celebrations, progress visualization, encouragement, streaks, and privacy messaging, following clean code and separation of concerns.
### Details:
Use explicit TypeScript interfaces for all props and state. Break down complex UI into small, maintainable components with meaningful names. Ensure components are decoupled and follow best practices for performance and maintainability[1][3][5].

## 3. Integrate Real-Time Audio and Backend Data [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.2
### Description: Connect UI components to real-time audio processing and backend APIs to trigger celebrations, update progress, and manage streaks based on user activity.
### Details:
Implement hooks or context providers to listen for audio events and backend updates. Ensure robust error handling for network and audio processing failures. Maintain clear separation between UI logic and data-fetching/business logic.

## 4. Implement Privacy Messaging and User Controls [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.2
### Description: Develop privacy messaging components and user controls, ensuring users are informed and can manage their data and celebration preferences.
### Details:
Create clear, accessible privacy messages and settings screens. Use TypeScript for all logic and ensure components are easily testable and maintainable. Handle edge cases and errors gracefully.

## 5. Comprehensive Testing and Code Quality Assurance [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.2, 13.3, 13.4
### Description: Write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for all components and logic. Enforce clean code, error handling, and maintainable architecture through code reviews and automated tooling.
### Details:
Use Jest and React Native Testing Library for component and logic tests. Validate TypeScript types and ensure strict compiler settings. Set up linting and formatting tools. Document architecture and testing strategies for maintainability.
