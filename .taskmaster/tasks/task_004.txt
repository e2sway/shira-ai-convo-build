# Task ID: 4
# Title: Build Live Audio Streaming UI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the core conversation interface for real-time audio streaming.
# Details:
Create ConversationScreen component. Implement expo-av for audio recording/playback. Display live transcript. Add voice input button, processing state, and replay/retry options. Style with NativeWind.

# Test Strategy:
Test audio recording, playback, and real-time transcript display. Validate UI responsiveness and accessibility.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design ConversationScreen Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the overall structure, component hierarchy, and data flow for the ConversationScreen, ensuring clear separation of concerns and maintainable architecture using TypeScript and React Native best practices.
### Details:
Establish component boundaries (e.g., AudioRecorder, TranscriptDisplay, PlaybackControls), plan state management (e.g., context, Redux, or hooks), and outline interfaces/types for props and state. Consider performance patterns such as memoization and lazy loading.

## 2. Implement Audio Recording Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Develop the audio recording module with real-time audio processing, error handling, and integration points for backend upload. Ensure clean code and TypeScript type safety.
### Details:
Use native modules or libraries for audio capture, handle permission requests, manage recording state, and expose a well-typed API. Implement robust error handling for device and permission failures.

## 3. Develop Audio Playback and Controls [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2
### Description: Create playback functionality with responsive controls (play, pause, seek), ensuring smooth UI updates and proper error handling.
### Details:
Integrate audio playback libraries, synchronize UI state with playback status, and handle edge cases (e.g., playback errors, interruptions). Use TypeScript interfaces for playback state and events.

## 4. Implement Live Transcript Display and Voice Input [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2
### Description: Build real-time transcript display and voice input features, integrating with backend transcription APIs and updating UI responsively.
### Details:
Stream audio data to backend, handle partial and final transcript updates, and display live transcription with clear UI feedback. Ensure accurate mapping between audio and transcript segments.

## 5. Manage UI States and Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4
### Description: Define and implement all UI states (idle, recording, transcribing, playback, error) with clear transitions and user feedback.
### Details:
Use enums or discriminated unions for state management in TypeScript. Display appropriate loading indicators, error messages, and retry options. Ensure all error cases are handled gracefully.

## 6. Apply Styling and Ensure Accessibility [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.5
### Description: Style components for cross-platform consistency and implement accessibility features such as screen reader support, proper color contrast, and voice-over compatibility.
### Details:
Use scalable styling approaches (e.g., styled-components, StyleSheet objects), responsive units, and platform-specific adjustments. Add accessibility labels, roles, and test with accessibility tools.

## 7. Comprehensive Testing and Code Quality Assurance [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6
### Description: Write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for all components and flows. Validate TypeScript types, enforce linting, and ensure maintainable, clean code.
### Details:
Use Jest and React Native Testing Library for component and logic tests. Mock native modules and backend APIs as needed. Validate accessibility and performance. Review code for separation of concerns and adherence to best practices.
