# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Conversation State Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Manage conversation state and session lifecycle.
# Details:
Use Zustand for local state. Track current conversation, session status, and user input. Handle session start, stop, and error recovery. Maintain conversation context.

# Test Strategy:
Test state transitions, session lifecycle, and error recovery. Validate context persistence.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up Zustand with TypeScript in React Native [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate Zustand into the React Native project with TypeScript, ensuring type safety and clean code practices. Establish the initial store structure, leveraging Zustand's hooks-based API and minimal boilerplate.
### Details:
Install Zustand and its TypeScript types. Create modular store slices for different concerns (e.g., conversation, session, audio). Use TypeScript interfaces/types for state and actions. Ensure the store is easily testable and maintainable, following separation of concerns.

## 2. Implement Conversation and Session State Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Design and implement state slices for tracking real-time conversation and session data, including user context, message history, and audio processing state.
### Details:
Define state structure for conversations, sessions, and audio streams. Use Zustand middleware (e.g., persist) for context persistence and hydration. Ensure state updates are atomic and performant, using selectors and shallow comparison to minimize re-renders.

## 3. Handle Lifecycle Events and Context Persistence [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Integrate lifecycle event handling (app foreground/background, session start/end) and ensure context is persisted and restored reliably across app restarts.
### Details:
Use Zustand's persist middleware with AsyncStorage for state persistence. Implement hydration flags and loading states. Listen to React Native AppState events to trigger state transitions and cleanup. Ensure seamless user experience during app lifecycle changes.

## 4. Implement Robust Error Handling and Recovery Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2, 9.3
### Description: Design error boundaries and recovery flows for state management, backend integration, and real-time audio processing. Ensure errors are surfaced, logged, and recoverable without corrupting session state.
### Details:
Use TypeScript discriminated unions for error states. Centralize error handling logic in the store. Implement retry and rollback strategies for failed operations. Integrate with backend error reporting and ensure UI feedback for critical failures.

## 5. Comprehensive Testing and Performance Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4
### Description: Develop unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for state management, lifecycle handling, and error recovery. Profile and optimize for React Native performance, especially for real-time audio and large session data.
### Details:
Write tests using Jest and React Native Testing Library. Mock Zustand stores for isolation. Test persistence, hydration, and error flows. Profile state updates and minimize unnecessary re-renders. Apply React Native performance best practices (e.g., memoization, batching).
