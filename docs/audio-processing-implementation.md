# Audio Processing Implementation (Task 2.5)

## Overview

This document outlines the complete implementation of audio processing functionality for the Shira AI Conversation Builder. The system enables real-time audio recording during conversations with chunked upload to Supabase Storage for immediate processing and analysis.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **AudioService** (`src/services/audioService.ts`)
   - Primary service for handling audio recording and upload
   - Chunked recording (2-second segments by default)
   - Queue-based upload system for network resilience
   - Comprehensive error handling and recovery

2. **AudioRecorder Component** (`src/components/AudioRecorder.tsx`)
   - React Native UI component for recording controls
   - Real-time recording status and progress display
   - User-friendly interface with start/stop/pause functionality

3. **Supabase Storage Integration**
   - Secure file storage with user-based folder structure
   - Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data protection
   - Audio chunk metadata tracking in database

## Key Features

### Chunked Recording
- **Chunk Duration**: Configurable (default 2 seconds)
- **Continuous Recording**: Seamless chunk rotation without gaps
- **Quality Options**: Low, Medium, High (configurable per session)
- **Format Support**: 
  - iOS: M4A (AAC encoding)
  - Android: MP3

### Real-time Upload
- **Immediate Processing**: Chunks uploaded as soon as recorded
- **Queue Management**: Network-resilient upload queue
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry on upload failures
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time upload status monitoring

### Security & Privacy
- **User Isolation**: Each user's audio stored in separate folders
- **RLS Policies**: Database-level security for audio metadata
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for all operations
- **MIME Type Validation**: Only audio files allowed in storage bucket

## Database Schema

### Audio Chunks Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE conversation_audio_chunks (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  chunk_id TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  conversation_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
  storage_path TEXT NOT NULL,
  sequence_number INTEGER NOT NULL,
  duration_ms INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  file_size INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  FOREIGN KEY (conversation_id) REFERENCES conversations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

### Storage Structure
```
audio-recordings/
  â””â”€â”€ {user_id}/
      â””â”€â”€ {conversation_id}/
          â”œâ”€â”€ chunk_1_{timestamp}.m4a
          â”œâ”€â”€ chunk_2_{timestamp}.m4a
          â””â”€â”€ ...
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Recording Setup
```typescript
import { audioService } from '../services/audioService';
import { AudioRecorder } from '../components';

// In your conversation component
const conversationId = "123";

const handleRecordingStart = () => {
  console.log('Recording started');
};

const handleRecordingStop = (session: IRecordingSession) => {
  console.log('Recording completed:', session);
  // Process completed session
};

// Render the recorder
<AudioRecorder
  conversationId={conversationId}
  onRecordingStart={handleRecordingStart}
  onRecordingStop={handleRecordingStop}
  onRecordingError={(error) => console.error(error)}
/>
```

### Advanced AudioService Usage
```typescript
import { audioService } from '../services/audioService';

// Start recording with custom options
const sessionId = await audioService.startRecording({
  conversationId: "123",
  chunkDuration: 3000, // 3 seconds
  quality: 'high',
  enableNoiseSuppression: true,
});

// Monitor recording status
const status = audioService.getRecordingStatus();
const session = audioService.getCurrentSession();
const queuedChunks = audioService.getQueuedChunksCount();

// Control recording
await audioService.pauseRecording();
await audioService.resumeRecording();
const completedSession = await audioService.stopRecording();
```

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Dependencies
Already included in package.json:
```json
{
  "react-native-audio-recorder-player": "^4.0.1",
  "expo-av": "~15.1.7",
  "@supabase/supabase-js": "^2.50.3"
}
```

### 2. Permissions
The AudioService automatically handles permission requests:
- **Android**: RECORD_AUDIO, WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
- **iOS**: Microphone access (automatic with first recording attempt)

### 3. Supabase Setup

#### Create Storage Bucket
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard â†’ Storage
2. Create bucket named `audio-recordings`
3. Set as Private (not public)
4. Configure settings:
   - File size limit: 50MB
   - Allowed MIME types: `audio/*`

#### Apply Storage Policies
Run the SQL from `supabase/storage_policies.sql`:
```sql
-- Users can upload to own folder
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload to own folder" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'audio-recordings' 
  AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);

-- Users can view own files
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own files" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (
  bucket_id = 'audio-recordings' 
  AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);
```

#### Create Audio Chunks Table
Run the migration from `supabase/migrations/003_create_audio_chunks_table.sql`:
```sql
CREATE TABLE conversation_audio_chunks (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  chunk_id TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  conversation_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
  storage_path TEXT NOT NULL,
  sequence_number INTEGER NOT NULL,
  duration_ms INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  file_size INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  FOREIGN KEY (conversation_id) REFERENCES conversations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```
